Bot-Giles

TODO:
-Split the Bulbapedia scraping logic into its own module.
-Reorganize the code a little. This is pretty old.
-Write some tests.
-Commit to CPAN eventually?

This module allows chat bot interaction with a program capable of scraping http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/

It was originally a school project, but could be made a little more useful through the above TODOs
